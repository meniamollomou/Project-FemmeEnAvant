# FemmeEnAvant â€“ Empowering Women in Guinea

## Project Overview

FemmeEnAvant (French for Ladies First) is a web platform designed to empower women in Guinea by providing access to important information, inspiring stories, and news. The goal is to make it easier for women to know their rights, learn from others, and stay updated on whatâ€™s happening around them.

This project is a work in progress, and it will include various sections such as:

- Know Your Rights: A section that lists womenâ€™s rights.
- Stories: A platform for women to share their own stories and be inspired by others.
- News: An updated feed about womenâ€™s issues and events related to Guinea.
- Contact: A way for users to connect with the platform.

## Features

### Working Features:

- Homepage with easy navigation and links to the main sections.
- Quote of the Day: A daily motivational quote fetched from an external API.
- Rights Page: Lists different categories of rights (e.g., marriage, education, violence protection). It currently uses placeholders, ready to be connected to an API.
- Stories Page: Allows users to share and read inspirational stories. Placeholder implemented.
- News Page: Displays static content for now, but the structure is set to integrate real-time news via GNews API in the future.
- Contact Form: Basic form to send messages to the platform. Placeholder functionality for now.

### Not Working Yet:

- API Integrations: Right now, data for rights, news, and stories is either static or placeholder. In the future, the app will fetch real-time data via the following APIs:

- News: GNews API for news related to Guinea and womenâ€™s issues.
- Rights: Integration with a backend API (or possibly JSON storage) for detailed womenâ€™s rights information.
